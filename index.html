    <h1>Coccinellidae</h1>
    <p>The majority of the more than 6,000 described species are generally considered beneficial insects, because many
      prey on herbivorous hemipterans such as aphids or scale insects, which are agricultural pests. Many coccinellids
      lay their eggs directly in aphid and scale insect colonies, ensuring their larvae have an immediate food source.
      However, some species such as the herbivorous Mexican bean beetle are agricultural pests.</p>

    <h1>Beneficial insect</h1>
    <p>Encouraging beneficial insects, by providing suitable living conditions, is a pest control strategy, often used
      in organic farming, organic gardening or integrated pest management. Companies specializing in biological pest
      control sell many types of beneficial insects, particularly for use in enclosed areas, like greenhouses.</p>

      reasons. Many of the modern principles of companion planting were present many centuries ago in forest gardens in
      Asia, and thousands of years ago in Mesoamerica.</p>
